# Boom-Online (aka Pop Tag, Crazy Arcade, etc)

This is my version of "Boom Online". This is my favorite game when I was a kid. I tried my best to replicate the rules of the game. This is a great project for
learning how to build a game using Gosu.



# To play, run:
  1) bundle install
  2) ruby ./lib/game.rb

After running the ruby script, the user will go through the following:
  I. Pick battle options  --- Page 1
    There are 2 battle options
      1) solo   -     2 players fight with each other
      2) team   -     2 players team up to go through a series of maps to defeat the final boss
    For the "team" option, there are 16 different levels, from easy to difficult, where level 16 is the final boss.
   
  II. Pick the character and boom for player #1 --- Page 2
    There are a variety of character and boom images for users to pick. They are just images and have no effect on the game.
    The keys corresponding to the player will be present on the screen
    ---> Click "NEXT" to proceed

  III. Pick the character and boom for player #2 --- Page 3
    see II.
    ---> Click "NEXT" to proceed

  IV. Summary
    A summary of what we have picked earlier --- Page 4
    ---> Click "START" to proceed

After clicking the "START" button, the game starts.
